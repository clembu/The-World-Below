# The World Below
---------------

This is a Jekyll-based website about a roleplaying campaign I run. Its wiki is a knowledge base of the player-characters and NPCs, and its blog is mainly a campaign log narrating the sessions one after the other.

The website is available at http://facelesspanda.github.io/The-World-Below/
